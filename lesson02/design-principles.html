            <p>The Rule of Thirds is viwed by positioning key elements, such as the logo and call-to-action, along grid
                lines and intersection points. This creates a
                visually balanced composition that is pleasing to the eye, improving the user experience.

            <p>The rule of Alignment masters the ability to define an ideal and recommended spacing in your design, the
                main objective of this principle is to unify and organize the page. But so that all the elements present
                can have harmony,
                it is ideal that there is visual communication.

            <p>The rule of repetition assumes that in the composition some element needs to be repeated to
                create identity and unity. This element can be a certain font, a characteristic color, a line style, a
                shape, etc. The repetition of the blue and orange color in this case is what creates the brand recall.
