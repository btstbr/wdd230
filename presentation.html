        <h2>Web Usability Principles - Week 10 Presentation</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/usability_one.jpg" alt="Usability"
                style="width: 50%; height: auto; justify-content: center;">
        </div>

        <h2>Yes, usability has become a product.</h2>
        <h5>Usability means user-centered design. The design development process is centered
            in
            around the potential user, to build products that are efficient and easy to use.</h5>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/usability.jpg" alt="Usability" style="width: 50%; height: auto; justify-content: center;">
        </div>


        <h2>1. Availability and Accessibility</h2>
        <h5>Hosting - It is important to ensure that your visitors do not receive an error when trying to load your
            website.
            Invest in good hosting.</h5>

        <p>1 - Broken links - Check that there are no broken links on your website. Nothing makes a visitor return to
            Google search results faster than a 404 page.</p>

        <p>2 - 2 - Mobile Responsiveness (Responsive) - Make sure your website can handle different
            sizes of
            screen and slow connections</p>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/voegol.png" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>

        <h2>2. Clarity - Less is More</h2>
        <h5>If you distract or confuse your visitors, they will need more time to find what they want.
            want or they may forget their initial goal. Either way, they won't experience your
            website and the chances are that they will leave unsatisfied and with no intention of returning.</h5>

        <p>1 - Simplicity - Focus on what is important. If you don't distract your visitors they will be more likely to
            do what you want them to do.</p>
        <p> 2 - Familiarity - Layout similar to what people already know. There is nothing wrong with searching in
            other places for inspiration.</p>
        <p> 3 - Consistency - Don't just look pretty. Create a consistent experience across your site to maintain
            your visitors at ease.</p>
        <p> 4 - Guidance - Take your visitors by the hand. Don't expect your visitors to explore your website
            all on your own. Instead, guide them through your website and show them what you have for
            offer.</p>
        <p> 5 - Direct feedback - Feedback is essential for any interaction. When people interact
            With your website, be sure to offer an indication of the success or failure of your actions.</p>
        <p> 6 - Good information architecture - Understand your visitors' mental models and what they expect
            that you structure the content on your website.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/apple.png" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>

        <h2>3. Familiar Appearance</h2>
        <h5>Familiar appearance is another important aspect of usability.

            It should be your goal to design intuitive interfaces - interfaces that don't require instructions,
            or even a long process of trial and error to understand them. Key to intuitive design is to make use of the
            that people already know, or create something new that is easy to learn.</h5>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/uol.png" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>

        <h2>4. Credibility</h2>
        <h5>Credibility is a crucial aspect of any website.

            Even if people find the content they are looking for, if they don't trust you, the content
            it's useless. Your website can make website visitors skeptical about your business in several ways,
            including doubts about whether you really exist, your reputation or the quality of your content.</h5>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/loreal.png" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>

        <h2>5. Relevance</h2>
        <h5>It's not enough for your website to be clear and usable, your content must also be relevant. Again,
            It's essential that you know your users and why they visit your site.</h5>

        <p>Start with defining who your users are. </p>
        <p>Secondly, talk to them to find out what they are
            your goals when visiting your website. </p>
        <p>Third, define user scenarios that demonstrate
            situation people visit the website to find what type of content. Any design decision you
            does should result in a more user-friendly site.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/nike.png" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>

        <h2>Usability means testing, testing and testing again</h2>
        <h5>Usability is not achieved overnight.

            It requires thorough user research and an iterative approach of constant testing and refinement.

            Good usability depends on whether your website is available, clear, credible, familiar and has relevant
            content
            to the people who actually use your products or services.</h5>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/usability2.jpg" alt="Gol Website" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>
